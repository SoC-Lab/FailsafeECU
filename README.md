# FailsafeECU

Develop a self-aware safety system for automotive systems based on ECUs. FPGA partial reconfiguration property is used to replace the faulty ECU functionality. The system includes a fault detection circuit, a selection mechanism to instantiate the replacement hardware to be partially reconfigured in runtime.
