address: 
01 THS (Throttle Sensor, salve)
10 MCU (Motor Control Unit, slave)
11 ECU (Electronic Control Unit, master)
00 control packet

Bit definitions for packet:
| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |    Bit number

| 0   0 |   to  |  from | 0   0 |    Request data
| 0   0 |   to  |  from | 1   1 |    Acknowledge
| 0   0 |   to  |  from | 0   1 |    Error 1
| 0   0 |   to  |  from | 1   0 |    Error 2

|   to  |         data          |    send data


Normal Operation:
1. ECU request data from THS (0b00011100)
2. THS return data (0b11XXXXXX)
3. ECU send data to MCU (0b10XXXXXX)
4. MCU return achnowledge (0b00111011)
1. ECU request data from THS (0b00011100)
...

Initialization:
ECU starts with 1.
all slaves waits for timeout
ECU repeats 1.
"real slave" answers if it is working
if not: ECU repeats 1. after timeout
"FPGA slave" answers with 2. and replaces the "real slave"

Error Handling:
case 1: slave sends error (0b0011XXXX)
    "FPGA slave" replaces "real slave" after next request
case 2: no answer from "real slave" within two tries
    "FPGA slave" replaces "real slave" after second timeout
